# SpaceBattle
This is a little project that I am working on in my free time. At this point in development, it is essentially just a space ship battle simulator. At the begining of the battle, the player gets to set up their fleet by selecting up to 9 squads of ships that battle an opposing team. The battle is divided into 3 waves. The player can put up to 3 squads in each wave, and set the amount of ships in each squad. The player can also currently set up their enemies team, or have the enemy team be randomly selected. Once in battle, the AI controlled ships battle it out and won't stop until the opposing fleet is destroyed.

This is a small part of a much larger strategy game. Outside of battles, the player will be able to collect resources and spend them on increasing the size of their fleets, ship upgrades, pilot upgrades, and various power ups.

Unfortunately, I am using a few asset packs from the Unity Asset Store, and I don't think the creatures of those assets would appreciate it very much if I uploaded those assets, so I won't be able to upload the entire project. But, I will be uploading my scripts as I create them.
